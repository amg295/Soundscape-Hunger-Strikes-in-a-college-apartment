Reflection:

The original premise for this soundscape was to incorporate different sounds found in a typical college student’s day through cooking and dietary habits. The goal was to show a smooth transition from breakfast to dinner in a way that was easy to follow. My initial concern was combining sounds that seemed random to the point where the listener could not associate them with a specific meal or time of day. I was inspired by the aspects of ASMR that amplified satisfying sounds found in one’s daily life. Originally, I was not planning on adding background music to the soundscape, but I found that it made the audio more cohesive and easier to listen to for a prolonged period of time. I received feedback that the original music that I chose seemed out of place so I changed it to the current jazzy tunes. Some of the challenges were finding sounds that would be recognizable without the use of descriptions. I wanted the sounds to be recordings that I had created from my own apartment. I tried to avoid using clips from other people in order to portray a piece of my personal experiences cooking in college. I also wanted listeners to relate to these sounds from either their college experience or experiences at home. Diet in college can often be very limited and This soundscape provides simple meals such as cereal and eggs for breakfast, skipping a full lunch and replacing it with snacks. The audio files were layered onto each other to show a progression therefore one will see that there are many different tracks. This is due to the fact that I recorded these sounds throughout the day that I then added to the project in succession. Initially I was only planning on incorporating food and kitchen noises, but I imported additional sounds from other aspects of the day such as walking and typing on the computer. This was mostly to break up the different meals and add to the narrative piece of the project.
