This is a soundscape of the different sounds found in the different meals that I cook throughout the day. It starts from breakfast to lunch and then to dinner.
The sounds were recorded from my personal experiences and supplemented with some sounds for walking and the alarm noise from freesounds.org. 
The music in this soundscape is from "Royalty Free Music from Bensound." - "jazzy frenchy"
There should be png photos of my progress in Audacity, an mp3 file, and the audacity aup file and its data folder
Hopefully the listener can pinpoint the different foods that are presented through these series of sounds from my apartment kitchen.
