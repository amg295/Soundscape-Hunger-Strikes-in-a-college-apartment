This is a soundscape of the different sounds found in the different meals that I cook throughout the day. It starts from breakfast to lunch and then to dinner.
The sounds were recorded from my personal experiences and supplemented with some sounds for walking and the alarm noise from freesounds.org. 
The music in this soundscape is from "Royalty Free Music from Bensound." - "jazzy frenchy"
There should be png photos of my progress in Audacity, an mp3 file, and the audacity aup file and its data folder
Hopefully the listener can pinpoint the different foods that are presented through these series of sounds from my apartment kitchen.

Introduction:
My vision for this soundscape was to take the listener through a day in my life through the perspective of food. 
My goal was to use recognizable sounds of everyday kitchen appliances and food sounds in order for the listener to follow the progression of the day from breakfast to dinner. 
The transitions of different sounds from Zoom or from a laptop are included to separate the different times of the day in order to make the soundscape easier to follow. 
In a way, this soundscape uses aspects of ASMR in order to present these sounds in a certain perspective and the POV of the person who is cooking and eating.
